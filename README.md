## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3:** The application is written in Python.
* **`mpv`:** A free, open-source, and cross-platform media player. Install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install mpv` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo pacman -S mpv` on Arch Linux).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/lofitui.git](https://github.com/your-username/lofitui.git)
    cd lofitui
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username/lofitui.git` with your actual repository URL)

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    The project uses a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Customizing presets

Edit `presets.json` to add new entries or adjust the order. Each preset must include a `name` and `url`. Restart the app after saving the file to load the updated list.
    The `run.sh` script will automatically create a virtual environment, install the necessary Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`), and then launch the application.

## Usage

To run the LofiTUI, simply execute the `run.sh` script:

```bash
./run.sh
